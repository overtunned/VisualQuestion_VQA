ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
tensorflow-gpu 2.1.0 requires gast==0.2.2, but you have gast 0.4.0 which is incompatible.
tensorflow-gpu 2.1.0 requires tensorboard<2.2.0,>=2.1.0, but you have tensorboard 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
tensorflow-gpu 2.1.0 requires tensorflow-estimator<2.2.0,>=2.1.0rc0, but you have tensorflow-estimator 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-multilingual-cased were not used when initializing BertModel: ['cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
